Hello! This is a balatro mod im working on semi-regularly, which plans to act as a Vanilla+ mod, with a large emphasis on MOAR jokers, or things related back to jokers. 

Currently its in a very early state with only a couple jokers added, but I have plans to add a lot more jokers - and other things like enhancements, editions, etc etc.
